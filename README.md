The site created shows the requirement information on the main page, but
in a different way than expected -- the entire site runs off a CentOS 7
VM, running under ESXi 5.5 (hypervisor), which in turn is running on a
server of mine that lives up in Atwater Kent. I've configured Heroku to
simply redirect to my own server, which should in the long run prove to be
much more flexible. I am aware that it is my duty to keep this server
running for the duration of the class such that it can host my projects,
and I accept the responsibilities that this entails.
